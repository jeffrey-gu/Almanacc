# Almanacc
Almanacc is an alumni connection application for IOS. It uses the Facebook API to pull friends' locations. Almanacc is convenient because it allows you to search a specific location and see all of your friends who are Almanacc users, in that location.

In order to test the application, you must be listed as an Application developer, since our app is not in production mode. If you would like to test the app, please contact a member of our team at jessehuang@wustl.edu, rahi.r.shah@wustl.edu, jshieh@wustl.edu, or  jeffreygu@wustl.edu.
